<p>Bitcoda has always enjoyed to experiment with new sounds and softwares more than anything else, after watching some fundraisers on the bitfund website see success it provides much motivation to create a small EP and so the work began. Bitcoda would like to invite others to try Bitcoin Cash and learn more about it as being introduced to the music inspired by it. Influences of Bitcoda include Eric Prydz and Markus Schulz. Bitcoda currently works in a small private home studio but dreams of one day composing in a Steve Aoki studio and working together with a vocalist. But who is Bitcoda? Much like <a href="https://www.billboard.com/files/media/deadmau5-2016-Music-Midtown-billboard-1548-a.jpg">Deadmau5</a> that may remain a mystery until more music has been made.</p>
