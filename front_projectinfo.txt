<b>EP Intro / Example / Preview Audio Clip</b>
<br><br>
<h2>Electronic Music EP</h2>
BITC0DA is a music project inspired by Bitcoin Cash attempting to pull together several genres: EDM, RetroWave, Psychedelic Trance, Vocal Trance, Electro House, Electronic Rock, Glitch, and Industrial while weaving in some vocals that relate to Bitcoin Cash. The example track posted above gives a feeling for the intro or style of the initial track. In order to complete the EP, a software beyond initial production software will be required: 1. <a href="https://www.vocaloid.com/en/products/show/v4l_cd_cs_english_sp_en">Vocaloid4</a> English Version - JPY 24,000. Depending on how well the fund goes, I can then purchase some mastering software or help with professional mastering to produce a high quality finished EP.
